    <strong>Question 1: Difference between const, let & var?</strong>
    <p>Ans: Var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. var variables
        can be updated and re-declared within its scope; let variables can be updated but not re-declared; const
        variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.</p><br>

    <strong>Question 2: Difference between regular & arrow funtion?></strong>
    <p>Ans: Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow
        functions are only callable and not constructible, arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions.
        Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.</p><br>

    <strong>Question 3: Why do we use template string in Javascript?</strong>
    <p>Ans: Template literals provide an easy way to interpolate variables and expressions into strings. The method is
        called
        string interpolation.</p>

    <strong>Question 4: difference between Foreach, Filter, Map?</strong>
    <p>Ans:<br> <strong>Foreach:</strong> Basically forEach works as a traditional for loop looping over the array and
        providing you array
        elements to do operations on them</p>

    <p> <strong>Filter :</strong> The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the
        array and executes
        the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value.</p>
    <p><strong>Map :</strong> Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array
        but whats makes it
        unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array.</p>
